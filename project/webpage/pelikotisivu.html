<p>The game is written in Python and takes advantage of a database written in 
mySQL (Python 3.4 &amp; mysql ). The database contains roughly the following items:</p>
<table align="center" class="auto-style1" style="width: 50%">
	<tr>
		<td>Items</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>NPCs</td>
		<td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rooms</td>
		<td>33</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Extra items</td>
		<td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Endings</td>
		<td>5</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game took about <em>3 weeks</em> to code and planning was about <em>2 weeks</em>. A lot of 
changes were made to the original plan when we noticed some things were either 
too ambitious or too lackluster to add to the game.</p>
<p>Our method of working included about 3 times weekly face-to-face work and 
almost daily online work. Tools we used to manage work &amp; communicate are 
<strong>discord</strong> 
and <strong>github</strong>.</p>
